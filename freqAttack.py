# I first look if letters that I know for sure (known_letters) 
# in w1 match w2, because if not then it is 100% sure that it is not the word I am comparing to. 
# And then if at the same time the current letter in w1 (l1) is not in known letters 
# (decrypted) and the current letter in w2 (l2) is not in known letters (encrypted) 
# then it is one missed letter and it still might be this word. Now for the final line : 
# if I have 0 missed letters found, then I have no interest to consider this word as correct because 
# all letter associations are already guessed (thus it is 1000), 
# but otherwise : if the word is long and few letters are missing there 
# is more chances that we found a correct word, than if the word is short but fewer letters are missing
# Therefore, the final distance is inverted. Voilaaa
